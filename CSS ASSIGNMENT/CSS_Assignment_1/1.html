      <h1><u>Super Mom</u></h1>
      <p>
        Mom, you're a wonderful mother,<br>
        So gentle, yet so strong.<br>
        The many ways you show you care<br>
        Always make me feel I belong.<br><br>
        You're patient when I'm foolish;<br>
        You give guidance when I ask;<br>
        It seems you can do most anything;<br>
        You're the master of every task.<br><br>
        You're a dependable source of comfort;<br>
        You're my cushion when I fall.<br>
        You help in times of trouble;<br>
        You support me whenever I call.<br><br>
        I love you more than you know;<br>
        You have my total respect.<br>
        If I had my choice of mothers,<br>
        You'd be the one I'd select!<br><br>
